/* Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. 
Your pro gram’s inputs should be: 
 • The cost of a new car 
 • The estimated miles driven per year 
 • The estimated gas price 
 • The efficiency in miles per gallon 
 • The estimated re-sale value after 5 years 
Compute the total cost of owning the car for five years.  
(For simplicity, we will not take the cost of financing into account.)  
Obtain realistic prices for a new and used hybrid and a comparable car from the Web. 
Run your program twice, using today’s gas price and 15,000 miles per year. */
