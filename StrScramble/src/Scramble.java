/*It is a well-known phenomenon that most people are easily able to read a text whose
words have two characters flipped, provided the first and last letter of each word are 
not changed. For example, 
 I dn’ot gvie a dman for a man taht can olny sepll a wrod one way. (Mrak Taiwn) 
Write a method String scramble(String word) that constructs a scrambled version of a 
given word, ran­domly flipping two characters other than the first and last one. Then 
write a program that reads words and prints the scrambled words.*/
